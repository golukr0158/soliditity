# NFT Marketplace

## Project Description

NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform built on Ethereum blockchain that enables users to mint, buy, sell, and trade Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The smart contract provides a secure and transparent marketplace where creators can showcase their digital assets and collectors can discover and purchase unique NFTs.

The platform combines ERC-721 token standards with marketplace functionality, allowing seamless NFT transactions with built-in royalty mechanisms and secure payment processing.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize digital art and collectibles by creating an accessible, transparent, and secure NFT marketplace that empowers creators and collectors worldwide. We aim to bridge the gap between traditional art markets and the digital economy, providing a platform where creativity meets blockchain technology.

We envision a future where:
- Artists have direct access to global markets without intermediaries
- Collectors can easily discover, verify, and trade authentic digital assets
- Smart contracts ensure fair and transparent transactions
- Community-driven curation promotes quality content
